**Updates to Dunman High Feedback App**
------
Observations of current webpage:
 - Webpage was not responsive (changing the width of the screen would cause certain buttons to overlap)
 - "Which area can we improve on?" button was not needed
 - "Which area can we improve on?" button has unreadable text (because of unresponsive webpage design)

What I updated: 
 - Added in Bootstrap (and removed link to css) to enhance the mobile responsiveness of the web app  
 - Removed the "Which area can we improve on?" button
 - Added in a pencil icon in the suggestions sections
 - Added in small text below the "Name" and "Email" sections to ensure to the users that the information would not be disclosed to the public (to gain user's trust)

Overall suggested improvements/feedback on app:
 - Could consider adding in other forms of input such as file upload in the case that the user wants to upload a photo (with the suggestion)
 - Could consider adding in a reply feature to allow admins to conduct follow-up actions with the student through the app and not use another app just to do so (increases user experience)
